    <h3>Bonfire History:</h3>
    <p>Did you know that bonfires were originally created by the Mayan Empire? 
    <p>They were thought to scare away</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spiders</li>
            <li>Giraffes</li>
            <li>The <strong>Spanish</strong></li>
        </ul>  
        
        which the Mayans thought to be
        creatures of darkness.
</p><p>
        Personally, I think they were right about at least two of those things.
